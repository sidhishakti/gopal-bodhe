        <h1>Gopal Bodhe</h1>
        <p class="hero-tagline">Author, photographer, and pioneer of aerial storytelling.</p>
        <p class="hero-bio">

          Born on 9 July 1948, Shri Gopal Bodhe served the Indian Navy for 32 years before
          devoting himself full-time to photography and authorship. What began as a practical
          skill for livelihood at the age of ten evolved into a lifelong pursuit of visual storytelling.
          He trained in advanced photography through international workshops and went on to
          explore diverse genres including nature, wildlife, aerial and infrared photography.
        </p>
        <p class="hero-bio">
          He is widely recognised as a pioneer of aerial photography in India. His topographic and
          environmental documentation includes aerial coverage of more than 8,500 km of
          India’s coastline and the Ladakh region, creating a rare visual archive of seascapes,
          forts, lighthouses and ancient trade routes. His 62-foot panoramic print of Mumbai’s
          Marine Drive, displayed at the World Photo Fair (1999) and now at the INS Vikrant
          Museum, has been recorded in the Limca Book of Records.
        </p>

        <p class="hero-bio">
          Beyond his published books, Shri Bodhe has conducted numerous workshops and
          slide shows for WWF-India, Bombay Natural History Society, Mumbai University and
          other institutions, using photography as a tool for environmental and heritage
          awareness. His exhibitions on Mumbai, Goa, Maharashtra and wildlife have attracted
          hundreds of thousands of visitors, often in collaboration with government and
          conservation bodies.
        </p>
        <p class="hero-bio">
          His photographic work has been appreciated by former Presidents and Prime
          Ministers of India, senior defence leadership and international dignitaries, and has
          earned several awards from national and municipal bodies. Through his images and
          books, he continues to inspire people to look at India’s natural and cultural landscape
          with renewed respect and responsibility.
